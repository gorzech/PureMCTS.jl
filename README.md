# PureMCTS.jl

Pure Julia implementation of the Monte Carlo Tree Seach algorithm. Designed to be used in connection with [Environments.jl](https://github.com/gorzech/Environments.jl).

## Acknowledgments

The code is based on the MCTS implementation done by [eleurent](https://github.com/eleurent) in the package [rl-agents](https://github.com/eleurent/rl-agents). The current implementation is redesigned and works only with deterministic systems and discrete action space.
